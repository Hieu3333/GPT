Possible ways to implement Differential transformer

1. Implementing Differential Attention in the Encoder
Selective Focus on Context: In an encoder-decoder setup, the encoder processes the input sequence by capturing relationships between tokens. Integrating differential attention here could mean focusing only on essential relationships, filtering out noisy or redundant token interactions at an early stage. This could be achieved by adjusting the differential attention mechanism to subtract irrelevant attention scores between tokens, resulting in cleaner embeddings passed to the decoder.
Handling Bidirectional Context: Since the encoder’s role often involves bidirectional attention, you’d need to adapt the differential attention by perhaps combining traditional attention in one direction with differential filtering in the other. This approach would allow the encoder to retain comprehensive context while still reducing noise selectively.
2. Applying Differential Attention in the Decoder
Sequential Differential Processing: Since the decoder typically attends to both the encoder outputs and its own past outputs, differential attention could focus more strongly on relevant portions of the encoder’s output while subtracting less relevant details. Here, differential attention could be used to improve response generation by dynamically filtering context based on both the input sequence and generated tokens.
Layer-Specific Differential Mechanisms: Another approach might be to apply differential attention only in certain layers of the decoder, particularly where filtering for relevance is most needed. This could help maintain a balance between the full context from the encoder and differential filtering within the decoder layers for smoother generation.
3. Cross-Attention Layer Modification
Differential Cross-Attention: Cross-attention layers in an encoder-decoder model are responsible for connecting encoder outputs with decoder inputs. Integrating differential attention in this layer could mean computing two cross-attention maps and subtracting them to filter out noisy information between encoder and decoder. This filtering could allow the model to focus on encoder outputs that are contextually aligned with the current decoding state, potentially making response generation more relevant and coherent.
4. Optimizing for Quantization and Efficiency
Since differential transformers also show robustness in quantization, applying these techniques across both encoder and decoder could lead to improved model efficiency without major sacrifices in accuracy. Quantization could allow for a compact encoder-decoder structure, making it practical for tasks with high memory demands, like summarization or multi-turn dialogue systems.
5. Potential Challenges and Adaptations
Maintaining Model Consistency: One of the main challenges would be ensuring that the differential attention doesn’t excessively filter out useful information, especially in the encoder. Setting up a balanced combination of differential and traditional attention in both encoder and decoder would likely require careful hyperparameter tuning.
Alignment with Pre-Trained Models: If initializing from pre-trained models like BERT or T5, compatibility adjustments, such as projection layers, may be needed to align differential attention outputs with pre-trained weights.
